## Overview
Gift Fairy is an application to keep track of a gift wish list. You can sign up to create a wish list and then share that wish list via email to friends or email. You can logout when you are done with your wish list and then sign back in to edit it at any time.

## User Story
As someone who likes to give and receive gifts, I want a website where I can input items on my wish list to share amongst friends and family.<br /><br />

GIVEN a website<br />
WHEN I visit the site for the first time<br />
THEN Iâ€™m presented with the homepage, which includes options to Sign Up (Create a Profile) or Log In<br />
WHEN I choose to Sign Up, I am prompted to enter Name, Email, Birthdate and Password<br />
THEN I can enter in items to my wish list and save the list or share the list via email<br />
WHEN I revisit the site at a later time and choose to sign in<br />
THEN I am prompted to enter Email and Password<br />
WHEN I am signed in, I can view my wish list and add or remove items
